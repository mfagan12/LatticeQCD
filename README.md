# Implementations of code from G. Peter LePage's Lattice QCD for Novices

LePage's paper is now over 2 decades old, with code written in Python 2 and using a version of NumPy before it was even called NumPy. In this repo, I aim to reimplementthe code in the paper in Julia and Python 3, both with versions meant to stick closely to the original, and with versions meant to employ better software practices.
