# Implementations of code from G. Peter LePage's _Lattice QCD for Novices_

LePage's paper is a beautiful example of non-trivial computational physics usually reserved for supercomputers that you can do at home. However, the paper is now over 2 decades old, with code written in Python 1 and using a version of NumPy before it was even called NumPy. In this repo, I aim to reimplement the code in the paper in Julia and Python 3. I plan to include versions in each language meant to stick closely to the original implementation, as well as versions meant to employ better software practices.
